**NOTE**: This conversion is still being tested, though as of June 21, 2014 all basic features appear to be working.

___

This addon was forked from [dektrium/yii2-user](https://github.com/dektrium/yii2-user), based on their version 0.6.0 and the [last June 17th 2014 commit](https://github.com/dektrium/yii2-user/commit/d36b851c8c913db4572faacedfc21b79f93b8834)

Most of web applications provide a way for users to register, log in or reset their forgotten passwords. Rather than re-implementing this on each application, you can use Yii2-user which is a flexible user management module for Yii2 that handles common tasks such as registration, authentication and password retrieval. Current version includes following features:

* Data lives and breaths in [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)
* Registration with an optional confirmation per mail
* Registration via social networks
* Password retrieval
* Account and profile management
* Console commands
* User management interface

> **NOTE:** Module is in initial development. Anything may change at any time.
